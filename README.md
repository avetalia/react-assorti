React-assorti is a collection of nice code-examples I wrote while studying ReactJS with Udemy courses, Medium articles and so on. Most of examples are made with React-hooks and styled-components but some can contain old approaches just to compare and keep it in case I need it for legacy projects.

I did it for personal use, but I would be glad if you will find it useful. 
Cheers!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
